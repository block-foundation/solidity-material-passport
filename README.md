**Welcome to the Sustainable Materials Passport Project, a pioneering initiative leveraging blockchain technology to promote and streamline sustainable material management practices. Our innovative project is centered around creating a decentralized and transparent system to track the lifecycle of materials, from their origin, through their use, and ultimately to their recycling or disposal.**

## Introduction

The Sustainable Materials Passport Project presents a forward-thinking solution for numerous stakeholders, including manufacturers, consumers, recyclers, and environmental advocates. Our goal is to enhance accountability, ensure ethical sourcing, and encourage recycling through our material tracking system.

At the core of our project, we utilize Solidity smart contracts to manage and maintain the Material Passport. Each passport contains detailed information about a material, including its origin, manufacturer, recyclability, type, and lifecycle stages.

The robust functionality of our system provides capabilities such as registering a new material, transferring ownership of a material, updating the lifecycle of a material, recycling a material, and even a reward system to incentivize recycling.

The Sustainable Materials Passport Project marks a significant step towards bridging the gap between blockchain technology and sustainable resource management. Through this initiative, we aim to foster a culture of sustainability and circular economy, making the world a better place for future generations.

## Features

- **Transparency**: Each material is registered on the blockchain, ensuring its history and properties are accessible and immutable.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Track and update the lifecycle of each material.
- **Recycling Incentives**: A reward system to incentivize recycling of materials.
- **Ownership Management**: Transfer ownership of materials and maintain a clear record of each transaction.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sustainable Materials Passport Project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ``` sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/SustainableMaterialsPassport.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ``` sh
   cd SustainableMaterialsPassport
   ```

## Dependencies

- **Solidity**: ^0.8.4
- **Truffle**: Latest version
- **Ganache**: For a personal blockchain for Ethereum development that runs on your desktop.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:

   ``` sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Start Ganache and make sure it's running.

3. Compile and migrate the contracts:

   ``` sh
   truffle compile
